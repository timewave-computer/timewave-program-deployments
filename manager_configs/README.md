# Program manager configs

This directory will hold all the configs for different enviroments

Each envirnment will have a directory with the name of the environment, there are 2 config structures we support for manager configs:

- Single file - A single file named `config.toml` which will hold all the configurations for the environment, Example: `manager_configs/local/config.toml`
- Multiple files - A directory with the name of the environment which will hold multiple files for different configurations, an example to this structure can be found in https://github.com/timewave-computer/valence-program-manager-config/tree/main/mainnet
